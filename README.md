# snap-filter
This is a hackathon entry for Snapchat's Snap Spotlight Lensathon
using Snapchat's official application, Lens Studio

  ## Project Purpose
   The idea is to create a filter that educates and normalizes 
   the concept of a prosthetic hand through Snapchat's filters 
   that overlays the user's own hand with that of a prosthetic
   
  ## Project Clarifications and Fair Use
  > The base material for hand-tracking technology was iterated 
  > through the use of a Lens Studio provided template.
  > All textures used are based on the open source
